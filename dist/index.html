          <h1 class="section-title">This is a site about <u>STORIES</u></h1>
          <p class="paragraph">This site is all about stories. The good, the bad, and the "so bad they're good." I'll be posting reviews of shows, films, games, and books that I've devoured. Though I'd like to think that I would approach reviews in a systematic and organized way, this is far from the truth. Sometimes you've just got to rant. Maybe over time I'll get better, but ranting is a lot of fun.

          I'll also be posting stories of my own. Short stories, screenplays ... maybe novels. Who knows? But at the very least I'll be making things up and posting them on here.

          And finally there's a blog. This may have some story related posts, with a focus on the philosophy and psychology behind stories. But my focus will be on putting my thoughts to paper on the topics inhabiting my mind at any given time. Be forewarned, I am a geek, so a majority of these will be nerdy.

          All that said and done, I hope you find something you enjoy on this website. If not, cool. I hope you find something you enjoy nonetheless.
