      "Meditation is a game changer. When you first try it, you might feel foolish. Frustrated, even. The deep-voiced guy on the app tells you to clear your mind and you think 'HOW?!' You struggle and strain to drop those pesky thoughts. They keep coming. This is the first lesson of meditation. Stop struggling.",
      "Meditation is not a forceful activity. Nor strenuous. It's a time to sit back and observe. The best metaphor I've heard for it is like observing a waterfall. Examine the thoughts. Let them cascade past you; don't grab at them. If you find yourself holding onto it, let go. And if another drop grabs your attention, let go. It is not easy, but you'll get better. Many times I've lunged at the thought waterfall. Repeatedly. And hey, if you get frustrated, then that is another drop of water that you've focused upon. Sit back and observe. Relax into it. The key point in meditation is simply awareness.",
      "Awareness of your emotions, your memories, your motives, your interactions. Then you see yourself clearer. You see why you are angry. Or sad. Or happy. And you realize most of the things that make you feel those ways are out of your control. This is life-changing. You'll learn truth about yourself, as well as a bit of how to better deal with your more powerful emotions. Then come an enlightening realization. All that exists for other people as well."
