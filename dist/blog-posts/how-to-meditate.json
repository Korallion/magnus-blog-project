      "1. Find a quiet location, away from others.",
      "2. Sit/lie/stand in a comfortable position.",
      "3. Set a timer for how long you want to meditate. Start low, 5 minutes. Increase time as you see fit.",
      "4. In your comfortable position, relax and observe your thoughts like a waterfall passing by. Visualize this waterfall if you wish.",
      "5. When you find yourself focusing on one thought or line of thought, let it flow away and return your attention to the waterfall.",
      "6. If you find yourself frustrated because you keep focusing on single thoughts, then congrats! You've focused on another single thought. Let it go and return your attention to the waterfall.",
      "NOTE: This is just one form of meditation. There are many out there, this is simply the one I do the most regularly."
